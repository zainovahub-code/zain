INSTRUCTIONS (Very Important)

1) DO NOT delete your existing tool files:
   password-generator.html, qr-code.html, youtube-thumbnail.html, age-calculator.html, image-compressor.html,
   word-counter.html, text-to-speech.html, currency-converter.html, unit-converter.html, ip-finder.html,
   color-picker.html, calculator.html

2) Upload index.html to /zain/
3) Upload everything inside /articles/ to /zain/articles/

Now each card has two buttons:
- Open Tool → opens the working tool page
- Read Guide → opens the article page (SEO content)

If a tool opens an article by mistake, re-upload the original tool file to overwrite the article.
